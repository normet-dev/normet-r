Description: Provides a suite of tools for advanced environmental time series analysis.
    Core functionalities include meteorological normalisation (de-weathering)
    to reveal underlying trends in data like air pollution concentrations,
    and causal inference using both classic and machine learning-based
    Synthetic Control Methods (SCM). The package features high-level workflows
    for uncertainty quantification, time-series decomposition, and robust
    placebo tests, all powered by a high-performance H2O AutoML backend.
