\arguments{
\item{df}{Data frame containing the input data.}

\item{model}{Pre-trained model for decomposition. If not provided, a model will be trained.}

\item{value}{The target variable name as a string.}

\item{backend}{The modeling backend to use if a model needs to be trained. Default is 'h2o'.}

\item{feature_names}{The names of the features used for training and decomposition.}

\item{split_method}{Method for splitting data. Default is 'random'.}

\item{fraction}{Proportion of data for training. Default is 0.75.}

\item{model_config}{A list of configuration parameters for model training.}

\item{n_samples}{Number of samples for normalisation. Default is 300.}

\item{seed}{A random seed for reproducibility. Default is 7654321.}

\item{n_cores}{Number of CPU cores for parallel processing.}

\item{memory_save}{Logical for memory-efficient normalisation. Default is FALSE.}

\item{verbose}{Should the function print progress messages and logs? Default is TRUE.}
}
\value{
The decomposed data frame with columns including `observed`, individual time-based
  contributions, `emi_total`, `emi_noise`, and `emi_base`.
}
\description{
\code{nm_decom_emi} performs decomposition of emissions influences on a time series.
This version is updated to match the more robust Python implementation logic.
