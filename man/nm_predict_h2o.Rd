\title{Predict using a trained H2O model with batching}
\usage{
nm_predict_h2o(
  model,
  newdata,
  feature_names = NULL,
  parallel = TRUE,
  verbose = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{A trained H2O model object.}

\item{newdata}{A data frame or data.table containing the feature matrix for prediction.}

\item{feature_names}{Optional character vector of feature names to use.}

\item{parallel}{Logical flag for multi-threading (not used directly here).}

\item{verbose}{Logical flag to enable logging messages.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of predicted values.
}
\description{
`nm_predict_h2o` performs predictions using a trained H2O model.
It supports automatic batching based on memory size, safely handles H2O
initialization, and is updated to correctly handle both data.frame and
data.table inputs during feature selection.
