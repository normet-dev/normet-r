\usage{
nm_scm_all(
  df,
  date_col,
  outcome_col,
  unit_col,
  donors = NULL,
  cutoff_date,
  scm_backend = "scm",
  n_cores = NULL,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A long-format panel data frame.}

\item{date_col}{The name of the date column.}

\item{outcome_col}{The name of the outcome variable column.}

\item{unit_col}{The name of the column containing unit identifiers.}

\item{donors}{A character vector specifying the donor pool. If NULL,
all other units are used as donors.}

\item{cutoff_date}{The treatment cutoff date in "YYYY-MM-DD" format.}

\item{scm_backend}{The synthetic control method to use: "scm" or "mlscm".}

\item{n_cores}{The number of parallel workers. Defaults to all available
cores minus one.}

\item{verbose}{Logical; whether to print INFO/WARN log messages.
Default is TRUE. Progress bar is always shown regardless of this flag.}

\item{cleanup_every}{Integer; how often to clear H2O memory (only relevant if mlscm+h2o).}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to the backend functions.}
}
\value{
A single, long-format data frame containing the combined results
  for all treated units.
}
\description{
Applies a synthetic control method to every unit in a dataset,
treating each one as the target unit in turn. Uses parallel execution
for the classic SCM backend, and serial execution for ML-SCM to avoid
conflicts with H2O clusters. Includes periodic memory cleanup.
